# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this project was to create a function to help automate access to a dataset that needs to be updated on a daily basis. The data pipeline we created extracts data from csv and json files, transforms the data by eliminating columns with filters, and using regular expressions to extract values. Finally, we load the transformed data into a sql database.
